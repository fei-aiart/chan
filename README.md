### Prerequisites

- Linux or similar environment
- Python 2.7
- NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN

### Getting Started

#### installation
- clone this repo:
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/fei-hdu/chan.git
cd chan
```
- install PyTorch 0.4+
#### Quick Start
- Download a dataset
    - [CUFS](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/archive/facesketch.html) splits of training and testing: [files](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TYQ5O9q4ZMiuBimPMqqj7O_SyHoijwmn)
    - CityScapes, Facades, Google Map, Edge2Shoes, Edge2Handbags: [Pix2Pix bash](https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix/blob/master/datasets/download_dataset.sh) 

<!--

- We use fine-tuning to train our model. For example, on the CUFS
    - first you need train on Pix2Pix to get a coarse model or you can Download a pre-trained model(pre-trained with [Pix2Pix](https://github.com/jehovahxu/pix2pix-pytorch)) in  [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dfe2pqAUD4T6fD9vO38SM2HCYJSe9Nxj)

-->

- Train:
    ```shell script
    python train.py --dataroot {dataset path} --datalist {datalist path} --pre_netG {coarse model path} --gpuid {your gpu ids}  
    ```

- Test:
    ```shell script
    python test.py --dataroot {dataset path} --datalist {datalist path} --pre_netG {final model path} --gpuid {your gpu ids}
    ```
#### Apply our pre-trained model
A *face photo-to-sketch* model pre-trained on the CUSF dataset: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=173H7FdwG7UOMM1G-4sm7zKUBu0yFypul)

The pre-trained model need to be save at `./checkpoint`

Then you can test this imodel.

### Results
Our final results can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AzmHkcGa21h6Mngdc7sEIH1hOR6GrBTS)

â€‹Our Quantitative performance in a variety of image-to-image translation tasks are shown below. We assign a *score* of +1, 0, or -1 to the best, mediate, and worst model according to each performance index. For each method, the total score on each dataset and that across all these datasets, are reported.

### Training/Test Tips
Best practice for training and testing your models.
